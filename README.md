# plot_2ray_exp_model
The plot_2ray_exp_model.m script simulates and visualizes the power delay profile (PDP) of wireless multipath fading channels using two fundamental models.
The Two-Ray Fading Model and the Exponential Power Delay Profile (PDP) Model. These models are essential in understanding how wireless signals are affected by reflections, 
scattering, and varying time delays in real-world propagation environments such as urban areas, indoor buildings, or vehicular networks.
